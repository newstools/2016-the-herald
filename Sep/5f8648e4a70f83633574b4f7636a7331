LLOYD CHITEMBWERobson Sharuko : Senior Sports EditorLLOYD CHITEMBWE is this week celebrating a year since returning for his latest spell as CAPS United head coach and the Green Machine s most decorated son has silenced some of those who questioned his appointment with his men well poised in the championship race to end more than 10 years of waiting for their fans. Chitembwe, whose charges take on Tsholotsho (edited) in a Chibuku Super Cup first round tie at the National Sports Stadium tomorrow, was hired in September last year after CAPS United had performed poorly in a number of league matches.A goalless draw against Buffaloes in his first match at the National Sports Stadium provoked outrage among those who questioned whether he was the right man for the job after Chitembwe s coaching career appeared to have been lost in the haze of Division One football where he could not make an impression.But one year later, those voices have been silenced as Chitembwe and his men are only a point behind leaders FC Platinum, in the championship race, their best position for some time, and there is growing expectation at the Green Machine that they can end 11 years of waiting for the league title.FC Platinum, though, remain the favourites but with a lot of points still at stake, anything is possible and those, at CAPS United, who are daring to dream, can be forgiven.Chitembwe has turned the National Sports Stadium into a fortress for CAPS United, where the Green Machine are unbeaten since the coach returned to take charge of the technical team in September last year.And, after more than six years of waiting, Chitembwe also delivered that elusive league win over bitter rivals Dynamos when CAPS United beat the Glamour Boys 1-0 at Rufaro this year.CAPS United, since Chitembwe s return, have outperformed both their biggest rivals Dynamos and Highlanders in the league.The Premiership s Big Three Clubs have all played 32 games and CAPS United have won 62 points after winning 17 games, drawing 11 matches and losing only four.Makepekepe have scored 44 goals and conceded 22 during that period.Highlanders, who have changed coaches along the way, have won more matches, 18, one more than the Green Machine but they have lost seven times while drawing six for a tally of 60 points.Bosso, who are in third place in the championship race and are walking with a spring in their step after completing a rare double over bitter rivals Dynamos, having scored 44 goals, the same number as Chitembwe s CAPS United since the coach s return to the Green Machine, while conceding 23, one more than Makepekepe.Dynamos, whose aura of invincibility over their major rivals was blown away in spectacular fashion this season, have had three coaches Tonderai Ndiraya, Paulo Silva and Lloyd Mutasa since Chitembwe returned to take over the hot seat at CAPS United.The Glamour Boys, whose chances of winning the league championship this season appear very slim, have also played 32 league matches during that period, won just 12, drew as many games and lost eight.They have scored 28 goals and conceded 23 and their tally of 48 points is 14 points behind what Chitembwe has harvested for the Green Machine during that period.&nbsp;Chitembwe s impressive home record since his return in September last yearCAPS United 0-0 BuffaloesCAPS United 3-1 HighlandersCAPS United 1-1 TriangleCAPS United 3-0 How MineCAPS United 3-1 WhawhaCAPS United 3-0 ChapunguCAPS United 2-1 Harare CityCAPS United 1-0 Border StrikersCAPS United 2-2 ZPC KaribaCAPS United 0-0 TriangleCAPS United 2-1 Bulawayo CityCAPS United 1-1 HwangeCAPS United 2-0 TsholotshoCAPS United 1-0 HighlandersCAPS United 0-0 FC PlatinumCAPS United 4-1 Mutare CityCAPS United 1-0 Chicken Inn&nbsp;CAPS UnitedP W D L F A Pts32 17 11 4 44 22 62&nbsp;HighlandersP W D L F A Pts32 18 6 7 44 23 60&nbsp;DynamosP W D L F A Pts32 12 12 8 28 23 48
