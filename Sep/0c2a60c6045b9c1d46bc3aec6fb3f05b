Edgar LunguLUSAKA. Zambian President Edgar Lungu appointed former accountant Felix Mutati as his finance minister on Wednesday as he began naming members of the cabinet following his delayed inauguration this week. Lungu s inauguration was postponed as the opposition contested the result of the August 11 election, worrying investors at a time when the major copper-producing nation needs to resume budget support talks with the International Monetary Fund.The 59-year-old, who was sworn in for a new five-year term on Tuesday, has said he would focus on unlocking agricultural potential in his tropical nation to reduce its dependence on copper mining.Mutati served as the Energy and Water Development Minister from 2002 to 2004 and subsequently, as the Commerce, Trade and Industry Minister from 2004 to 2011, during which time he coordinated international efforts to harmonize regional trade and investment.President Lungu also appointed Davis Chama, Patriotic Front secretary general, as defence minister.The new cabinet must tackle slowing growth due to depressed copper prices that have caused a 9 percent fall in the kwacha currency against the dollar since April, and consumer inflation that has nearly tripled to 20 percent year-on-year.The swearing in ceremony of the cabinet ministers and provincial ministers took place yesterday, state house spokesman Amos Chanda said in a statement.Meanwhile, stakeholders in Zambia on Wednesday urged President Lungu to ensure that former ministers pay back money in salaries and other allowances they accrued when they illegally occupied their offices as he embarks on his five-year term.On August 8 this year, the Constitutional Court ordered the ministers and their deputies to vacate their offices after they had remained in offices following the dissolution of parliament in May.The court also ordered them to pay back money they had accrued in salaries and allowances during the period. Chimfwembe Mweenge, co-chairperson of the Zambia Elections Information Center (ZEIC), said Lungu should ensure that the former ministers and their deputies paid back the money they accrued.
